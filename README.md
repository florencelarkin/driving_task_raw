This is the source code for the mobile version of the RAMP Task.

This is a demo version where the data that is recorded is displayed on screen at the end of each trial.

To save the data, use ctrl+a to select the text and then copy and paste that into a text file.

To run this task, or modify it for your own use, you will need to install flutter on your machine,
which you can do by following the instructions here: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

It will run on a web browser, and also on iOS and Android devices.

Alternatively you can test it on your browser through github pages using this link: https://florencelarkin.github.io/ramp_task/#/
